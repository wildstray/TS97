# TS97
This repository contains my first professional firmware project, a telephonic panic alert device. After 23 years, I decided to release it on Github (without a license, it's only historical and I think useless material).
I collected original material as is in the folders:
* **sch**: handwritten notes and hand drawn schematics.
* **src**: sources (ST9 macro assembler)
* **doc**: datasheets
Sorry, comments, notes and schematics reports mostly Italian descriptions and names.

## History behind
This was my first significant professional assignment. In the previous years I was doing little jobs for computer shops or in the production/repair/testing of electronic things. The year after, I begun to work for ISP doing network and system administrator and then engineer. I wrote this firmware in macro assembler, with a simple IDE (under DOS) of hardware emulator. The first proto boards was hand wired, with DIL headers for ribbon cable for the emulator. The second was a pre production PCB with a PLCC44 socket for the ST90E28. I used windowed EPROM version for testing lastest releases. At that times there were no smartphones or digital cameras, so I don't have pictures or videos of my work.

# TS97
This repository contains my first professional firmware project, a telephonic panic alert device. After 23 years, I decided to release it on Github (without a license, it's only historical and I think useless).
I collected original material as is: in the folder **sch** there are handwritten notes and hand drawn schematics. In the folder **src** there are the sources (ST9 macro assembler). Sorry, notes and schematics reports only Italian descriptions and names.

## Schematics
